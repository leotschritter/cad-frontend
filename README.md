# Tripico
**Tripico** is a cloud-native, multi-tenant travel planning application that enables users to create, share, and discover travel itineraries. The system provides comprehensive travel planning features including itinerary management, personalized recommendations, real-time weather forecasts, travel warnings, and social interactions through comments and likes.

The application is built as a microservices architecture deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), utilizing GKE Autopilot for orchestration, Firestore for document storage, Neo4j for graph-based recommendations, and Google Identity Platform for multi-tenant user authentication.
